# Changelog

## [3.3] - 2026-03-07
### WebUI
- Restyled Deep Doze level buttons.
- Progress display fixed for Enable All / Revert All / Reapply Settings.
- Fixed Enable All / Revert all ignoring RAM Optimizer.
- Improved whitelist selection menu.
### Shell / Backend
- **Kernel Tweaks**: `%%|*` parsing fixed, which was causing every kernel tweak path and value to parse as empty, hence the 0/0 applied counter that appeared in the activity log.
- Fixed hardcoded functions both in WebUI and shell files, causing some operations to unnecessarily apply twice. Made `frosty.sh` the main backend.
- Removed some old dead variables from WebUI.
- Fixed Deep Doze always enabling data saver.
- **General improvements to logs**: Better headers and separators format, added summary to GMS services log.
- And many more code cleanup and fixes.

## [3.2] - 2026-03-05
### Improved RAM Optimizer
- **Android process management**: Caps cached background processes at 10 and empty (dead-weight) processes at 5 via `device_config`. Empty processes are now evicted after 30 seconds instead of the default 30 minutes.
- **USAP pool**: Pre-forks Zygote processes at boot so cold app launches start faster.
- **Added new RAM tweaks with proper backup/restore**: 
`swappiness=100` (pushes stale anonymous pages to zram sooner)
`page-cluster=0` (disables pointless swap readahead on zram devices)
`watermark_scale_factor=30` (kernel reclaims memory proactively before stalls occur)
`extra_free_kbytes=8192` (LMKD starts evicting cached apps slightly earlier; skipped silently if the path does not exist on the kernel).
- **Proper backup/restore**: Mirrors the kernel tweaks pattern exactly. Actual pre-Frosty sysfs values are saved to `backup/ram_values.txt` on first enable and restored on revert.
### New Tracing Nuking
- **`traced` RC stub was missing**: `traced` was already stubbed as a binary in `post-fs-data.sh` but its init RC override was absent, meaning the Perfetto main daemon could still be started by init before the binary stub took effect. RC entry added.
- **`persist.traced.enable=0`** added to `system.prop` to disable Perfetto at the framework level as a belt-and-suspenders measure alongside the binary/RC stubs.
- **`traced_perf` and `traced_probes`** added to the runtime kill loop in `frosty.sh` so all three Perfetto daemons are killed immediately when Log Killing is toggled on from the WebUI.
### Log Killing: DropBox Categories
- **25 Android DropBox diagnostic categories** are now disabled when Log Killing is enabled. This disables system-level crash and diagnostic log collector that accumulates dumps in `/data/system/dropbox/` continuously. 
- **`tombstoned.max_anr_count=0`** added alongside the existing `tombstoned.max_tombstone_count=0`. This caps the ANR trace counter for `/data/anr/` separately from the tombstones counter.
- **Qualcomm Wi-Fi trace logging disabled**: `sys.wifitracing.started=0` and `persist.vendor.wifienhancelog=0` added unconditionally (no-ops on non-Qualcomm devices).

## [3.1] - 2026-03-04
- **Added NEW Ram Optimizer**: It sets `max_cached_processes=10` via both cmd device_config and settings put (for more android versions compatibility), plus enables USAP pool for faster cold launches. Revert deletes both keys, returning to system defaults with no residual state.
- **GMS Services**: 10 new telemetry entries added: GoogleHelpService, PhenotypeOperationService, PhResetService, HerrevadAndroidService, UdcService, UdcMddService, FocusAndroidService, stats.DropBoxEntryAddedService, gms.location.nearby.direct.service.NearbyDirectService, com.google.mainline.telemetry.
- **Deep Doze**: no longer spawns a background subshell if the last one is killed mid-sleep.
- **GMS Doze**: no longer patches other conflicting XML files from other modules, will only cause issues if kept.
- **WebUI Visual Overhaul**: cleaner style with better vibrant colors.

## [3.0] - 2026-03-03
### Module Internationalization
- **14 languages support**: The entire module and WebUI are now fully translated, supporting English, French, German, Polish, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese (BR), Turkish, Indonesian, Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese Simplified, Japanese, and Arabic.
- **Auto language detection**: The UI detects your device locale during installation and prompts you to use the detected language or stay on English. All subsequent output is printed in the chosen language. A language picker in the WebUI lets you override the detected language at any time from the menu.
### WebUI New Features and Fixes
- **Force Reapply Settings button**: Re-applies every currently enabled setting in one tap.
- **Import / Export**: Back up your current configuration to a JSON file in `/sdcard/Frosty` and restore it later.
- **About dialog**: Displays module version, description, and credits inline in the WebUI.
- **system.prop deletion bug**: The System Props toggle was calling `rm` on `system.prop.old` instead of `mv`, permanently destroying the file on enable. Fixed to always use `mv` in both directions so the file is never lost.
### Misc
- **No more setup wizard**: The installer no longer prompts you for anything during setup. All 14 volume-key interactions have been removed. Everything is configured in WebUI after reboot instead.
-**Kernel tweaks are no longer hardcoded**: They are now stored in `kernel_tweaks.txt` for better maintainability.
- **Removed `action.sh`**: Configuration is now done through the WebUI. Magisk users can use [WebUI-X](https://github.com/MMRLApp/WebUI-X-Portable/releases).
- And many more internal fixes for a more robust and clean code.

## [2.5] - 2026-02-28
### Installation QoL:
- **Config detection**: Reinstalling now detects an existing configuration and lets you keep it, skipping the full setup flow.
- **Whitelist preservation**: Doze whitelist is backed up and restored automatically on update.
### WebUI Improvements:
- **Scrollbar removed**: Page scrollbar is now fully hidden for a cleaner look.
- **Pull to refresh**: Fixed incorrectly triggering while scrolling inside the whitelist editor.
- **Whitelist icon loading**: Icons now pre-load further ahead and decode off the main thread, significantly reducing blank icons when scrolling fast.
- **Action buttons**: Freeze All / Revert All redesigned to be more compact with bolder text.
- **Added version badge**: Header now displays the current installed module version.
- **Interaction polish**: Text selection disabled on header, icons, and buttons to prevent accidental highlight on tap (thanks again @xizt159 for the fix!). 
> [!NOTE]
> **Magisk users can use [WebUI-X](https://github.com/MMRLApp/WebUI-X-Portable/releases)**

## [2.4] - 2026-02-27
- **WebUI overhaul**: Adopted KSU dynamic color system so the UI now follows your device's Material You wallpaper palette. With much better fluidity now.
- **System Props are now optional**: user is prompted during installation and can toggle them via WebUI or action button. With update safe detection and better logging.
- **Installation improvements**: All tweak descriptions rewritten to describe user facing effects rather than technical internals.

## [2.3] - 2026-02-26
- **Added KSU v3 WebUI**: Full configuration interface with live toggles, immediate apply/revert for all settings, Deep Doze whitelist editor with session activity log. Magisk users can use [WebUI-X](https://github.com/MMRLApp/WebUI-X-Portable/releases).
- **Cloud category adjustment**: Now holds all the critical API broker services that can affect Autofill, Smart Lock, and Google Sign-in. Defaulting to SKIP for more overall usability.
- **Background and Wearables categories fixes**: moved some services where they logically belong.
- **Screen monitor polling intervals increased**: 90s when screen on (was 60s), 180s for fallback/waiting (was 120s). Reduces CPU wakeups.
- Wakelock killer now checks process state before force stopping it, to avoid disrupting foreground apps like music, navigation. With better fallback for other roms.
- Moved RC overlays and bin stubs to `post-fs-data.sh` for more robust early-stage work. They are now created following user's choice, log killing is easily reverted on reboot.
- Kernel values are backed up on every boot instead of being skipped if a backup already exists, ensuring restore always reflects pre-tweak values from the current session.
- **Reworked `system.prop` tweaks**.
- **Many more fixes and adjustments to improve overall functionality**.

## [2.2] - 2026-02-16
- **GPS fix**: GMS Doze is now location-aware, when Location category is skipped, GMS stays in the deviceidle whitelist so Fused Location Provider can serve GPS to apps. XML patches still reduce battery drain without breaking location. Also fixed action button not re-enabling its services.
- **Deep Doze protects GMS when location is active**: GMS is automatically whitelisted from background restrictions when user chose not to freeze location.
- **GMS cache clearing**: Improved behavior. Now only clears GMS's own cache and code_cache directories.
- **Harmful system.prop entries removed**
- **XML patching**: Now uses fixed string matching (`grep -F`) instead of fragile regex with embedded quotes.
- **Whitelist matching**: Comments, trailing whitespace, and inline comments in `doze_whitelist.txt` are now properly stripped before matching.
- **Doze constants**: Split to two presets: Moderate and Maximum.
- **Kernel backup/restore**: All kernel values are backed up before tweaking. Stock mode via action button now instantly restores original values instead of requiring a reboot.
- **Screen monitor hardened**: Falls back to longer sleep intervals when display service is unavailable instead of rapid-cycling. Better clean shutdown.
- And many more fixes.
